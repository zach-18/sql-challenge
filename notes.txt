Data Modeling was done 3 times to ensure I had the right 1:many relationships to allow the right tables to be built.

In order to save each analysis, I created a separate file for each analysis:
sqlchallengepz_query_1.sql was the first of 8 analysis, and so on.

For the bonus, I created a Jupyter notebook, and imported the CSVs.
(I ran out of time to download the SQL file).

I did create a histogram, but not the bar chart.

and for the epilogue,
